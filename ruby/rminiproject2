#HISTOGRAM TIME BITCHES

puts "Type somthing and I'll count it for you: "

text = gets.chomp
words = text.split
frequencies = Hash.new(0)
#(0)means that the key's value will always start with 0

words.each{ |word|
  frequencies[word] += 1
}

frequency = frequencies.sort_by do
  |thing, count|
  something
end

frequency.reverse!
#sort_by sorts it in order from small to big so we
#make it sort from big to small by doing .reverse!

frequency.each{ |word,count|
  puts word + " " + count.to_s
}
#to_s converts the integer into a string
