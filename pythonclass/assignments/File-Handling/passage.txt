The behavior of matter and radiation on the atomic scale often seems 
peculiar, and the consequences of quantum theory are accordingly 
difficult to understand and to believe. Its concepts frequently conflict 
with common-sense notions derived from observations of the everyday world. 
There is no reason, however, why the behavior of the atomic world 
should conform to that of the familiar, large-scale world. It is 
important to realize that quantum mechanics is a branch of physics 
and that the business of physics is to describe and account for 
the way the world—on both the large and the small scale—actually 
is and not how one imagines it or would like it to be.
